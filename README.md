👋 Hello from Justin!

I'm a recovering perfectionist; my inner child is scared of me.

# Did you know…?

- 🎮 Video games are art; I like playing and [creating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_08) them.
- 🐶 I love animals...have two kids and one grand daughter.
- 📖 Reading makes me think while keeping me curious. 
- 💻 I like making computers work hard to help us all move forward.
- 🎉 The right picture can be worth all the words.
- 👷 I dont have a job, I have a purpose...to serve others for the betterment of mankind.
